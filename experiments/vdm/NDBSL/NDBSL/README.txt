The Non-programmer database system (NDB) is a nicely engineered binary 
relational database system invented by Norman Winterbottom of IBM. The 
formal Specification of NDB was originally undertaken by Anne Walshe, 
who has subsequently documented the specification and its refinement. 
NDB has been used as an example problem for modular specification in 
VDM-SL. However, the version available here is a "flat" specification. 
The postscript file includes a significant description of the validation 
of the specification using execution. Test coverage is not used though.

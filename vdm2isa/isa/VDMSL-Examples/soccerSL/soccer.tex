This tutorial example is taken out of a  VDM course given
to the students of the Dipl\^{o}me d'Etudes Sup\'erieures Sp\'ecialis\'ees en
G\'enie Informatique (5th year) at the Universit\'e Joseph Fourier. A first 
version uses the implicit style of specification of VDM-SL and thus may not be
executed with the IFAD toolbox. An explicit version is given as an appendix.

\section{Informal statement}

The following example models the referee's book for a soccer game. Its goal is
to model the rules for the substitution of players during a game.

The rules may be informally stated as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A soccer team consists of up to eleven players and a set of substitutes.
\item At most one of the players is the goal-keeper. 
\item The rules of soccer allow for the substitution of a player by one of the
substitutes. 
\item Once a player has been replaced by another, he may no longer take part in
the match.
\item There is a maximum number of allowed substitutions (usually one goal
keeper and two field players).
\end{itemize}
 
During the 1994 World Cup, a problem arose about the interpretation of these
rules when the goal keeper of Italy was excluded during a match against Norway.
The important phases of this match
were: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The italian goalkeeper Pagliuka (number 1) is excluded.
\item Baggio (number 10) exits the field and is substituted by the substitute
goalkeeper (number 12).
\item Two further substitutions of field players are performed.
\end{enumerate}

The question was then to know whether the rules had been followed or not. How
many field player substitutions did actually take place?

To model this particular problem, we need a further rule:

\begin{itemize}
\item The referee may exclude one of the players (including the substitutes).
\end{itemize}

Finally, the FIFA rules also allow to exchange the role of goalkeeper between
two players. This change must be formally notified to the referee (who must
always know who is allowed to touch the ball with his hands).

\subsection{The System State and Events} 


\begin{vdm_al}
  RExchange ::
   status: map Subscriber to Status
   calls:  inmap Subscriber to Subscriber
 inv mk_RExchange(status, calls) == 
    forall i in set dom calls & 
       (status(i) = <WI> and status(calls(i)) = <WR>) 
       or
       (status(i) = <SI> and status(calls(i)) = <SR>)
 ;
 
 state Exchange of
   status: map Subscriber to Status
   calls:  inmap Subscriber to Subscriber
 inv mk_Exchange(status, calls) == 
    true -- forall i in set dom calls & 
    --    (status(i) = <WI> and status(calls(i)) = <WR>) 
    --    or
    --    (status(i) = <SI> and status(calls(i)) = <SR>)
 end

\end{vdm_al}

This invariant formalizes the fact that, in this telephone exchange, telephone
conversions are between two subscribers only (that is, we have no conference
calls). Furthermore a call between two subscribers is established if the two
are waiting in order to speak or both are speaking.


In the following the possible events of the exchange are specified.
\subsubsection{Lift}
The event $Lift$ is caused by a free subscriber lifting his handset. He thus
becomes an attempting initiator with status $AI$.

\begin{vdm_al}

operations

  Lift(s: Subscriber)
  ext wr status
  pre s in set dom (status :> {<fr>})
-- pre s in set dom status and status(s) = <fr>
  post status = status~ ++ {s |-> <AI>};
\end{vdm_al}
\subsubsection{Connect}
The event Connect is caused by a spontaneous activity of the exchange which,
connects an attempting initiator to a free subscriber. This two subscribers
become respectively a waiting initiator and a waiting recipient (whose 
telephone starts to ring).
\begin{vdm_al}
  Connect(i: Subscriber, r: Subscriber)
  ext wr status
      wr calls
  pre i in set dom (status :> {<AI>}) and
      r in set dom (status :> {<fr>})
  post status = status~ ++ {i |-> <WI>, r |-> <WR>} and
       calls = calls~ ++ {i |-> r};
\end{vdm_al}

\subsubsection{MakeUn}
The event MakeUn is also caused by a spontaneous activity of the exchange
which decides to punish an attempting initiator who has seized a line for too
long a period of time without succeeding in connecting to another subscriber.

\begin{vdm_al}
  MakeUn(i: Subscriber)
  ext wr status
  pre i in set dom (status :> {<AI>}) 
  post status = status~ ++ {i |-> <un>};
\end{vdm_al}

\subsubsection{Answer}
The event Answer is caused by a waiting recipient lifting his handset: he
might do so because his telephone is ringing or, spontaneously, after he has
temporarily suspended an already engaged telephone conversation.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Answer(r: Subscriber)    
  ext rd calls
      wr status
  pre r in set dom (status :> {<WR>}) 
  post status = status~ ++ {r |-> <SR>, (inverse calls)(r) |-> <SI>};  
\end{vdm_al}

\subsubsection{ClearAttempt, ClearWait, ClearSpeak}
These events clears a telephone conversation and are  caused by an
initiator who hangs up. 

After all three events the initiator reenters the status $fr$. In the second
and third cases, there exists a corresponding recipient who enters the status
$fr$ (if he is waiting) or $un$ (if he is speaking).
\begin{vdm_al}
  ClearAttempt(i: Subscriber)
  ext wr status
  pre  i in set dom (status :> {<AI>}) 
  post status = status~ ++ {i |-> <fr>};
\end{vdm_al}


\begin{vdm_al}
  ClearWait(i: Subscriber)
  ext wr status
      wr calls
  pre  i in set dom (status :> {<WI>}) 
  post status = status~ ++ {i |-> <fr>, calls(i) |-> <fr>} and
       calls =  {i} <-: calls~;
\end{vdm_al}


\begin{vdm_al}
  ClearSpeak(i: Subscriber)
  ext wr status
      wr calls
  pre  i in set dom (status :> {<SI>}) 
  post status = status~ ++ {i |-> <fr>, calls(i) |-> <un>} and
       calls =  {i} <-: calls~;
\end{vdm_al}
\subsubsection{Suspend}
When a speaking recipient hangs up, the corresponding event is called Suspend
because, the conversation is only suspended. In fact, both our recipient and
his corresponding initiator enter a waiting status. As can be seen, we reach
exactly the same situation as was the case after the Connect event, the only
difference being that, this time, the recipient's telephone is not ringing. 
\begin{vdm_al}
  Suspend(r: Subscriber)
  ext rd calls
      wr status
  pre r in set dom (status :> {<SR>}) 
  post status = status~ ++ {r |-> <WR>, (inverse calls)(r) |-> <WI>};
\end{vdm_al}
\subsubsection{ClearUn}
The last event to consider is the one by which an unavailable subscriber
hangs up. The subscriber becomes free again.
\begin{vdm_al}
  ClearUn(s: Subscriber)
  ext wr status
  pre s in set dom (status :> {<un>})
  post  status = status~ ++ {s |-> <fr>}

end EXCH

This VDM model is made by Peter Gorm Larsen as an exploration of how
the looseness in a subset of VDM-SL. So this is illustrating how it is
possible to explore all models is a simple fashion including the
possibility of recursive functions where looseness is involved inside
each recursive call. A paper about this work have been published as:

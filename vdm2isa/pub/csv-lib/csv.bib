@inproceedings{10.1145/3274856.3274879,
	abstract = {The need for error checking is essential in our daily activities, as the saying goes "to err is human". This issue becomes problematic when it involves hidden errors. Depending on the hidden errors, in critical systems this can lead to a tragedy or disaster. There are two possible solutions, either preventing the error or detecting and correcting the error. In the case of file system detection and correction is more effective. In this work we consider the later case of error detection and correction, here we develop a scalable tabular technique for detecting errors in a file system. We apply the technique on a CSV file system with developing an application. The application detects and corrects errors in a CSV file. Scalability is one of the strength that differentiate this work from other related work. This scalability of the application provides an easy way for expanding the scope of possible errors that can be detected and corrected. The work contributes in illustrating a technique that improves confidence in the well-known legacy file CSV. This is very important considering the role of CSV file in transmission and processing of data, especially in data migration. The result of this work indicates a promising scalable approach for error detection and correction on a file system like CSV file.},
